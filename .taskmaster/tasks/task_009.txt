# Task ID: 9
# Title: Refactor 'Our Tools' Section into Multi-Level Categorized Catalog
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Transform the existing flat tools list into a hierarchical, multi-page catalog with categories, subcategories, and tool detail pages, updating navigation and data structures accordingly.
# Details:
1. Redesign the tools data structure in script.js to support a hierarchy: categories, subcategories, and tools. Example structure: [{ category: 'Elektronarzędzia...', subcategories: [{ name: 'Wkrętarki', tools: [...] }, ...] }, ...].
2. Replace the single tools section with a homepage view that displays main categories as clickable cards or links.
3. For each category, create a dedicated page (or dynamic view if using client-side routing) listing its subcategories. Each subcategory should link to its own page displaying the relevant tools.
4. Update the navigation bar: convert the 'Narzędzia' link into a dropdown menu listing all main categories. Ensure dropdown is accessible and works on mobile (consider touch and keyboard navigation best practices[1][5]).
5. Implement client-side routing (using hash-based or history API) or generate separate HTML files for each category/subcategory page, ensuring smooth navigation and back/forward browser support.
6. Ensure all new pages and navigation elements are fully responsive and visually consistent with the existing theme.
7. Refactor and modularize JavaScript to handle rendering of categories, subcategories, and tool lists dynamically based on the new data structure.
8. Update any smooth scrolling or CTA logic to accommodate the new multi-page/catalog structure.

# Test Strategy:
- Verify that the homepage displays all main categories as intended.
- Test navigation: clicking a category in the navbar dropdown or homepage leads to the correct category page; clicking a subcategory leads to the correct tool list.
- Confirm that the navigation dropdown is accessible and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Check that the new data structure in script.js correctly renders all categories, subcategories, and tools, and that adding/removing items updates the UI without manual HTML changes.
- Ensure all new pages/views are fully responsive and match the site's design.
- Test browser navigation (back/forward) and direct linking to category/subcategory pages.
- Validate that all interactive elements (dropdown, links) work as expected across devices and browsers.
