# Task ID: 7
# Title: Optimize Performance and Accessibility
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the website for fast loading, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.
# Details:
Optimize images (use WebP/AVIF formats). Implement lazy loading for images and iframes. Add alt text for images. Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards. Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Use modern CSS and JS features with fallbacks for older browsers.

# Test Strategy:
Test page load speed (Lighthouse). Check accessibility with tools like axe or WAVE. Verify cross-browser compatibility.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Optimize Images Using WebP/AVIF [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Convert existing images to modern formats like WebP and AVIF to reduce file size and improve loading speed without sacrificing quality.
### Details:
Identify all images used on the site. Use tools or scripts to convert images to WebP and AVIF formats. Update image references in the code to use these optimized formats, leveraging the <picture> element and srcset for responsive delivery.

## 2. Implement Lazy Loading for Images [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Defer the loading of images that are not immediately visible in the viewport to improve initial page load performance.
### Details:
Use the native loading="lazy" attribute for images where supported, and implement a JavaScript-based lazy loading solution (e.g., using Intersection Observer API) for broader compatibility. Ensure all image tags are updated accordingly.

## 3. Add Alt Text and ARIA Attributes [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Ensure all images have descriptive alt text and add appropriate ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility for users with assistive technologies.
### Details:
Review all image elements and provide meaningful alt text. For complex images or interactive elements, add ARIA roles and labels as needed to meet WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.

## 4. Check Color Contrast and Accessibility [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Evaluate the website's color contrast and overall accessibility to ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines.
### Details:
Use tools like WAVE, aXe, or Lighthouse to audit color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text) and other accessibility issues. Adjust CSS and markup as needed to resolve any identified problems.

## 5. Test Cross-Browser Compatibility [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Verify that all optimizations and accessibility improvements work consistently across major browsers and devices.
### Details:
Use tools such as BrowserStack or LambdaTest to test the site in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and on mobile devices. Check for layout, image format support, and accessibility issues.

## 6. Add Fallbacks for Older Browsers [done]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Implement fallback solutions for browsers that do not support modern image formats or lazy loading features.
### Details:
Use the <picture> element to provide JPEG/PNG fallbacks for browsers that do not support WebP/AVIF. Add polyfills or alternative scripts for lazy loading and ARIA features where necessary. Test to ensure graceful degradation.
