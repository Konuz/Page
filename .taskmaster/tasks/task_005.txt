# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Tools Section with Dynamic Content
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the tools section, allowing easy addition/removal of tools via a simple JavaScript object array.
# Details:
Create a tools section that displays a list of tools (initially: Wiertarka udarowa, Betoniarka, Piła ukośnica). Store tool data in a JavaScript array of objects in script.js (e.g., [{name: 'Wiertarka udarowa', description: '...', image: '...'}, ...]). Use JavaScript to dynamically render tools from this array. Ensure new tools can be added or removed by editing only this array, without changing HTML structure.

# Test Strategy:
Verify tools are displayed from the array. Test adding/removing tools by editing the array and checking the page updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define JavaScript Object Array for Tools [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a JavaScript array where each element is an object representing a tool, including properties such as name, description, and any relevant metadata.
### Details:
Ensure the array is structured for easy iteration and manipulation, following best practices for object arrays in JavaScript.

## 2. Render Tool List Dynamically [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement logic to iterate over the tools array and generate corresponding DOM elements for each tool, displaying them on the page.
### Details:
Use JavaScript to create and insert elements into the DOM based on the current state of the tools array.

## 3. Style Tool Cards [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Apply CSS styles to the rendered tool elements to present them as visually distinct cards.
### Details:
Ensure the cards are responsive and visually appealing, using classes or inline styles as appropriate.

## 4. Implement Add/Remove Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Add JavaScript functions to allow users to add new tools to the array and remove existing ones, updating the rendered list accordingly.
### Details:
Ensure that the UI updates in real time as tools are added or removed from the array.

## 5. Test Dynamic Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Verify that adding and removing tools updates both the data array and the rendered UI correctly, and handle any edge cases.
### Details:
Test with various scenarios, such as adding duplicate tools or removing all tools, to ensure robustness.
