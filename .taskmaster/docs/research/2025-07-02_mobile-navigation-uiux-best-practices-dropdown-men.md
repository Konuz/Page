# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** mobile navigation UI/UX best practices: dropdown menu vs. side-drawer. Focus on usability for a simple site with 3-4 links.

**Response:**

**For a simple mobile site with 3–4 navigation links, a dropdown menu in the header is generally more usable and efficient than a side-drawer (hamburger) menu.**

## Dropdown Menu vs. Side-Drawer: Usability Comparison

| Feature                | Dropdown Menu (Header)                | Side-Drawer (Hamburger)           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Visibility**         | All links visible or one tap away     | Links hidden behind an icon       |
| **Interaction**        | Tap to open, tap to select            | Tap hamburger, then tap link      |
| **Speed**              | Fewer taps to reach content           | Extra tap to open drawer          |
| **Screen Space**       | Minimal overlay, less intrusive       | Covers part/all of screen         |
| **Best for**           | Few links, simple navigation          | Many links, complex structures    |
| **Accessibility**      | Easier for all users to discover      | Hamburger icon can be missed      |

## Key Usability Insights

- **Dropdown menus** are ideal for simple sites with only a few navigation links. They keep navigation visible and accessible, reducing the number of taps needed to reach content. This is especially important for users who may not recognize the hamburger icon or who expect navigation to be immediately available[2][4].
- **Side-drawers (hamburger menus)** are best suited for apps or sites with complex navigation structures, multiple categories, or secondary options (like settings or profiles). They help declutter the main interface but add an extra step to access navigation, which can slow users down and reduce discoverability for primary links[1][3].

## Best Practices for Mobile Navigation (Simple Sites)

- **Dropdown Menu:**
  - Place the menu in the header, clearly labeled (e.g., “Menu” or with a down arrow).
  - Make all navigation links visible with a single tap.
  - Use clear, large touch targets for each link.
  - Avoid nesting links for such a small number of items.
  - Ensure the dropdown is accessible (keyboard/tab navigation, ARIA roles)[2][4].

- **Side-Drawer:**
  - Only use if you anticipate adding more links or sections in the future.
  - Make the hamburger icon large and clearly visible.
  - Provide visual feedback when the drawer is open.
  - Ensure the drawer can be closed easily (tap outside, swipe, or close button)[1][3].

## Recommendation for Your Project

Given your site’s simplicity (3–4 links, one-page layout), **a dropdown menu in the header is the most user-friendly and efficient choice**. It aligns with mobile-first best practices, keeps navigation discoverable, and minimizes friction for users. Only consider a side-drawer if you expect the navigation to grow significantly or need to hide secondary options.

**Actionable Steps:**
- Implement a dropdown menu in the header for mobile.
- Ensure the menu is accessible and touch-friendly.
- Test on real devices for tap accuracy and visibility.

This approach will provide the best balance of usability, speed, and clarity for your users.
