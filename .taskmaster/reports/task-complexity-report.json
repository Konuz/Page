		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Initial Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository setup into subtasks such as: (1) Create repository on chosen platform, (2) Establish directory structure, (3) Initialize with HTML5 template and tooling, (4) Add .gitignore and verify initial load.",
			"reasoning": "This task is straightforward and procedural, involving standard steps for initializing a web project. Complexity is low as it requires no advanced logic or integration, but benefits from clear subtask separation for tracking and verification."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Responsive Layout",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the layout implementation into: (1) Base mobile-first layout with CSS Grid/Flexbox, (2) Media queries for responsiveness, (3) Font and color scheme setup, (4) Section styling for cohesion, (5) CSS variables for theme management.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple CSS techniques and design considerations, requiring careful planning for responsiveness and visual consistency. Moderate complexity due to the need for cross-device compatibility and maintainable theming."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Hero Section with CTA",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Structure Hero section in HTML, (2) Add and style headline, description, and CTA button, (3) Implement background image/illustration, (4) Add smooth scrolling functionality with JavaScript.",
			"reasoning": "While the Hero section is visually important, its implementation is relatively standard. The only dynamic aspect is smooth scrolling, which is a common JavaScript task. Complexity is slightly above basic due to integration of design and interactivity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build 'Why Us?' Section with Icon Tiles",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Create section structure, (2) Add and style four icon tiles, (3) Integrate SVG icons, (4) Ensure responsive layout and accessibility.",
			"reasoning": "This task is modular and visually oriented, involving repeated elements (tiles) and SVG integration. Complexity is moderate due to the need for responsive design and icon handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Tools Section with Dynamic Content",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Define JavaScript object array for tools, (2) Render tool list dynamically, (3) Style tool cards, (4) Implement add/remove logic, (5) Test dynamic updates.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces dynamic content rendering and data-driven UI, requiring JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation. Slightly higher complexity due to the need for maintainable, extensible code and testing dynamic updates."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Contact and Location Section",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Add contact info markup, (2) Embed and configure Google Maps iframe, (3) Style section for consistency, (4) Ensure responsiveness and efficient loading.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves embedding third-party content and ensuring responsive design. Complexity is moderate, mainly due to integration and styling rather than logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance and Accessibility",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Optimize images (WebP/AVIF), (2) Implement lazy loading, (3) Add alt text and ARIA attributes, (4) Check color contrast and accessibility, (5) Test cross-browser compatibility, (6) Add fallbacks for older browsers.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires a broad set of optimizations across performance, accessibility, and compatibility. It involves both code and testing, with multiple interdependent concerns, making it one of the more complex tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Final Review, Testing, and Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Review all sections for consistency, (2) Test all interactive elements, (3) Perform end-to-end device/browser testing, (4) Deploy to chosen hosting platform, (5) Verify public accessibility and requirements.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers comprehensive review, testing, and deployment, requiring coordination and thoroughness. Complexity is elevated due to the need for integration testing and deployment steps, but is mitigated by the procedural nature of the subtasks."
