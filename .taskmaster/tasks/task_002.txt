# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design and Implement Responsive Layout
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a responsive layout for the one-page website, ensuring compatibility with mobile and desktop devices. The basic HTML structure and global CSS styles have been completed, including the page skeleton (header, sections, footer), global styles, color palette, and foundational responsiveness.
# Details:
Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout. Implement a mobile-first approach. Use media queries to adapt layout for different screen sizes. Choose a clean, modern sans-serif font (e.g., 'Inter', 'Roboto', or 'Open Sans'). Apply color scheme: beige/cream background, dark text, orange accents for buttons and highlights. Ensure all sections are visually distinct but cohesive. Use CSS variables for easy theme management. Build upon the existing foundation of the index.html skeleton and style.css global styles and responsiveness to enhance layout and visual polish.

# Test Strategy:
Test layout on multiple devices and screen sizes using browser developer tools and real devices. Check for visual consistency, readability, and smooth responsiveness. Verify that the existing global styles and structure integrate well with new layout enhancements.
