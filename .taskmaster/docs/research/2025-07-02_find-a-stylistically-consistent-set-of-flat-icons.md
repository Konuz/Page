# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Find a stylistically consistent set of flat icons with a yellow and grey color scheme for the following tools: impact drill, miter saw, concrete mixer. The style should be similar to the example image provided by the user.

**Response:**

A stylistically consistent set of **flat icons** with a **yellow and grey color scheme** for construction tools can be sourced from specialized icon packs designed for this aesthetic. The following resources and approaches are recommended for your project:

### Recommended Icon Pack

- **Flaticon "Construction Tools - Yellow Shadow" Pack**  
  This pack features a cohesive set of flat icons with a yellow and grey palette, matching the style described in your query. The icons are available in SVG format, ensuring scalability and easy integration into your responsive layout. The pack includes a variety of construction tools, and you can select icons for:
  - **Impact drill**
  - **Miter saw**
  - **Concrete mixer**
  
  These icons are designed with a modern, minimal look and use yellow as the primary accent with grey for outlines and details, aligning with your project's visual requirements[5].

### Additional Visual References

- **Pinterest Example**  
  A visual reference on Pinterest showcases a poster with flat construction tool icons in yellow and grey, demonstrating the style's effectiveness for clarity and modern appeal. This can serve as inspiration or a benchmark for the icons you select or customize[3].

### Implementation Tips

- **SVG Format**: Use SVG icons for crisp rendering at any size and easy CSS color overrides if minor adjustments are needed.
- **Consistency**: Ensure all selected icons come from the same pack or designer to maintain visual harmony across the tools section.
- **Accessibility**: Add descriptive `alt` text to each icon for improved accessibility, as required by your performance and accessibility optimization tasks.

### How to Apply

- Download the relevant icons from the Flaticon "Construction Tools - Yellow Shadow" pack[5].
- Place the SVG files in your `/images/` directory.
- Reference the SVGs directly in your HTML or as background images in CSS for each tool in your dynamic tools array.
- If a specific tool icon (e.g., miter saw) is missing, consider using a similar icon from the same pack or customizing an existing SVG to match the required tool.

This approach ensures your tools section will feature visually consistent, modern, and accessible icons that align with your established color scheme and design standards.
